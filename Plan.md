## Technical Implementation Details

### Theme Storage and Limitations

Based on the existing `ThemeEditor` component, we'll need to:

1. Store themes in a database with user associations
2. Track theme count per user
3. Implement feature flags based on subscription status

```typescript
interface Theme {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  config: ThemeConfig;
  userId: string;
  isPrivate: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  versions?: ThemeVersion[];
}

interface ThemeVersion {
  id: string;
  themeId: string;
  config: ThemeConfig;
  createdAt: Date;
  name?: string;
}
```
